functions are defined by using `fn` keyword. A example of function definition is given below.
```rust
fn add_two_numbers(num: i32, num2: i32) -> i32 {
    let sum: i32 = num + num2;
    return sum;
}
```

This function can be called by using `add_two_numbers(56,44)`. Here `return` keyword is used to return function value. although this is not necessary as if expression is without semicolon, then that last expression is automatically return as function's value. So upper function can also be written as below.

```rust
fn add_two_numbers(num: i32, num2: i32) -> i32 {
    let sum: i32 = num + num2;
    sum
}
```

As last line can be expression instead of simple variable. the function can futher be shorten as below.
```rust
fn add_two_numbers(num: i32, num2: i32) -> i32 {
    num + num2
}
```
