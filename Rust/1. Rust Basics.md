## 1.1 Program Structure

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## 1.2 Variables
A variable can be declared with `let` keyword as following, here `i32` is variable type.
```rust
let num: i32;
```

Further we can assign value during declaration as below.
```rust
let num: i32;
num = 64;
```

Above code can also be written in single line.
```rust
let num: i32 = 64;
```

By default a variable is immutable. to declare a mutable variable we can use `mut` keyword as below.
```rust
let mut num i32 = 64;
```

## 1.3 Conditional statement
### IF statement

```rust
let num: i32 = 51;
if num % 5 == 0 {
    println!("{} is divisible by 5.", num);
}
```

### IF .. ELSE statement

```rust
let counter: i32 = 51;
if counter % 2 == 0 {
    println!("{} is a even number.", counter);
} else {
    println!("{} is a odd number.", counter);
}
```

### ELSE IF .. ELSE Statement

```rust
let percentage: i32 = 85;

if percentage > 85 {
    println!("grade A");
} else if percentage > 50 {
    println!("grade B");
} else {
    println!("grade C");
}
```

## Loops
### while
```rust
let mut counter: i32 = 1;
while counter <= 10 {
    println!("counting ... {}", counter);
    if counter % 2 == 0 {
        println!("{} is a even number.", counter);
    } else {
        println!("{} is a odd number.", counter);
    }
    counter += 1;
}
```
### loop
```rust
let mut counter: i32 = 1;
loop {
    if counter > fav_number {
        break;
    }
    println!("counting with loop .. {}", counter);
    counter += 1;
}
```
### for
```rust
for num in 1..11 {
    println!("counting with for loop .. {}", num);
}
```
